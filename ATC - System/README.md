## Architecture & Design

Provide an overview of how the system is structured. For example:

- **Modules / Components**  
  - *Flight Controller*: handles flight plan input, updates, and monitoring  
  - *Airspace Manager*: manages sectors, altitude assignments, separation  
  - *Scheduler*: coordinates takeoff/landing slots  
  - *User Interface / CLI / API*: methods of interaction  

- **Technology Stack**  
  - Programming Languages: e.g. Java / C# / Python / JavaScript  
  - Frameworks / Libraries: e.g. Node.js, Django, React, etc.  
  - Database: e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.  
  - External APIs or tools used  

- **Design Decisions**  
  - Why certain patterns / architectural choices were made (e.g. microservices vs monolith, event-driven communication, etc.)  
  - Any trade-offs considered
